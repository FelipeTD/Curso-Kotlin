You can declare your own functions in Kotlin using the fun keyword.

fun hello() {
    return println("Hello, world!")
}

fun main() {
    hello()
    // Hello, world!
}

In Kotlin:

function parameters are written within parentheses ().

each parameter must have a type, and multiple parameters must be separated by commas ,.

the return type is written after the function's parentheses (), separated by a colon :.

the body of a function is written within curly braces {}.

the return keyword is used to exit or return something from a function.

If a function doesn't return anything useful, the return type and return keyword can be omitted. 
Learn more about this in Functions without return.

In the following example:

x and y are function parameters.

x and y have type Int.

the function's return type is Int.

the function returns a sum of x and y when called.

fun sum(x: Int, y: Int): Int {
    return x + y
}

fun main() {
    println(sum(1, 2))
    // 3
}

We recommend in our coding conventions that you name functions starting with a lowercase letter and use camel case with no underscores.
