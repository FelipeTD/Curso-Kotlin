Write a function called circleArea that takes the radius of a circle in integer format as a parameter and outputs the area of that circle.

In this exercise, you import a package so that you can access the value of pi via PI. For more information about importing packages, see Packages and imports.

import kotlin.math.PI

fun circleArea(radius: Int): Double {
    return PI * radius * radius
}
fun main() {
    println(circleArea(2))
}

Rewrite the circleArea function from the previous exercise as a single-expression function.

import kotlin.math.PI

fun circleArea(radius: Int): Double = PI * radius * radius

fun main() {
    println(circleArea(2))
}

You have a function that translates a time interval given in hours, minutes, and seconds into seconds. 
In most cases, you need to pass only one or two function parameters while the rest are equal to 0. 
Improve the function and the code that calls it by using default parameter values and named arguments so that the code is easier to read.

fun intervalInSeconds(hours: Int = 0, minutes: Int = 0, seconds: Int = 0) =
    ((hours * 60) + minutes) * 60 + seconds

fun main() {
    println(intervalInSeconds(1, 20, 15))
    println(intervalInSeconds(minutes = 1, seconds = 25))
    println(intervalInSeconds(hours = 2))
    println(intervalInSeconds(minutes = 10))
    println(intervalInSeconds(hours = 1, seconds = 1))
}
