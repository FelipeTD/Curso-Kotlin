To make your code more concise, you can use single-expression functions. For example, the sum() function can be shortened:

fun sum(x: Int, y: Int): Int {
    return x + y
}

fun main() {
    println(sum(1, 2))
    // 3
}

You can remove the curly braces {} and declare the function body using the assignment operator =.
And due to Kotlin's type inference, you can also omit the return type. The sum() function then becomes one line:

fun sum(x: Int, y: Int) = x + y

fun main() {
    println(sum(1, 2))
    // 3
}

Omitting the return type is only possible when your function has no body ({}). Unless your function's return type is Unit.
