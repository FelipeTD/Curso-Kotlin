read-only variables with val
mutable variables with var

fun main() { 
    val popcorn = 5    // There are 5 boxes of popcorn
    val hotdog = 7     // There are 7 hotdogs
    var customers = 10 // There are 10 customers in the queue

    // Some customers leave the queue
    customers = 8
    println(customers)
    // 8
}

Variables can be declared outside the main() function at the beginning of your program. Variables declared in this way are said to be declared at top level.
