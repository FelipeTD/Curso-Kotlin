With this knowledge, you can declare variables and initialize them later. 
Kotlin can manage this as long as variables are initialized before the first read.

To declare a variable without initializing it, specify its type with :

fun main() {
    // Variable declared without initialization
    val d: Int
    // Variable initialized
    d = 3

    // Variable explicitly typed and initialized
    val e: String = "hello"

    // Variables can be read because they have been initialized
    println(d) // 3
    println(e) // hello
}
