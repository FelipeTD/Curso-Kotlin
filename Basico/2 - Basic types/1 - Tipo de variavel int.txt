Every variable and data structure in Kotlin has a data type. 
Data types are important because they tell the compiler what you are allowed to do with that variable or data structure. 
In other words, what functions and properties it has.

In the last chapter, Kotlin was able to tell in the previous example that customers has type: Int. 
Kotlin's ability to infer the data type is called type inference. customers is assigned an integer value. 
From this, Kotlin infers that customers has numerical data type: Int. As a result, the compiler knows that you can perform arithmetic operations with customers:

fun main() {
    var customers = 10

    // Some customers leave the queue
    customers = 8

    customers = customers + 3 // Example of addition: 11
    customers += 7            // Example of addition: 18
    customers -= 3            // Example of subtraction: 15
    customers *= 2            // Example of multiplication: 30
    customers /= 3            // Example of division: 10

    println(customers) // 10
}
