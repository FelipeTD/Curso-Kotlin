You can provide a default value to return if a null value is detected by using the Elvis operator ?:.

Write on the left-hand side of the Elvis operator what should be checked for a null value. 
Write on the right-hand side of the Elvis operator what should be returned if a null value is detected.

In the following example, nullString is null so the safe call to access the length property returns a null value. As a result, the Elvis operator returns 0:

fun main() {
    var nullString: String? = null
    println(nullString?.length ?: 0)
    // 0
}
