Using a when expression, update the following program so that when you input the names of GameBoy buttons, the actions are printed to output.

Button		Action
A		Yes
B		No
X		Menu
Y		Nothing
Other		There is no such button

fun main() {
    val button = "A"

    println(
        when (button) {
            "A" -> "Yes"
            "B" -> "No"
            "X" -> "Menu"
            "Y" -> "Nothing"
            else -> "There is no such button"
        }
    )
}

You have a program that counts pizza slices until thereâ€™s a whole pizza with 8 slices. Refactor this program in two ways:

Use a while loop.

fun main() {
    var pizzaSlices = 0
    while ( pizzaSlices < 7 ) {
        pizzaSlices++
        println("There's only $pizzaSlices slice/s of pizza :(")
    }
    pizzaSlices++
    println("There are $pizzaSlices slices of pizza. Hooray! We have a whole pizza! :D")
}

Use a do-while loop.

fun main() {
    var pizzaSlices = 0
    
    do {
	println("There's only $pizzaSlices slice/s of pizza :(")
        pizzaSlices++
    } while (pizzaSlices < 8)
    println("There are $pizzaSlices slices of pizza. Hooray! We have a whole pizza! :D")
}

Write a program that simulates the Fizz buzz game. 
Your task is to print numbers from 1 to 100 incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", 
and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz". Any number divisible by both 3 and 5 must be replaced with the word "fizzbuzz".

fun main() {
    for (number in 1..100) {
        println(
            when {
                number % 15 == 0 -> "fizzbuzz"
                number % 3 == 0 -> "fizz"
                number % 5 == 0 -> "buzz"
                else -> number.toString()
            }
        )
    }
}

You have a list of words. Use for and if to print only the words that start with the letter l.

fun main() {
    val words = listOf("dinosaur", "limousine", "magazine", "language")
    for (w in words) {
        if (w.startsWith("l"))
            println(w)
    }
}
